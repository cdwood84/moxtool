This repository is primarily for technical learning but should eventually build a simple set of tools I might use for my DJ project.  The code will comprise a web application to collect first party data, an ETL to enrich with 3rd party data, and scratch space for data analysis.

The application can be accessed via Python Anywhere -- https://enterthemox.pythonanywhere.com/
